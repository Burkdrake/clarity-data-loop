### Payment Rate Controls

Providers can now set minimum payment rates for their data streams:

- Minimum payment rate validation prevents undervalued subscriptions
- Ensures fair compensation for high-value data streams
- Automatic validation during payment stream initialization
- Configurable per stream based on data value

```clarity
;; Create stream with minimum payment rate
(contract-call? .data-loop create-stream name description category price min-payment-rate)
```
